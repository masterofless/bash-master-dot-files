bash-master-dot-files
=====================

I love bash.  These things help.

Update for 2014: I love fish!

Caveats
-------

To make these files I cut/paste from the *real* files, of course, for a bunch of reasons that basically boil down to a lack of discipline.

The point of these files isn't to demonstrate how to manage and integrate everything, but rather some enhancements to your *nix environment to consider adding into your own framework for managing such things.

This isn't all bash.  git, vim, etc. have nothing to do with bash exactly.  Reasoning why I chose the name I did is an exercise left to you.
